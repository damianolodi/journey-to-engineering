As for everyone, the new year is the best time to set new goals and, for me this year, is the perfect time to start writing something on my new website!

It took a while before having it up and running, mainly because _I always want to start everything from scratch,_ even projects that are far too long and complicated. In this case, I know HTML and CSS, but creating colour palettes and graphical design is not really my bread and butter, so to say.

Finally, I settled on using [Academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/), a super nice theme for the Hugo templating language. I really fell in love with this theme because it has almost every feature I wanted, especially the one required to highlight information in the **Notes** section. If you too are undecided on how to create your personal website (and you don't need very complex UI design), I would highly recommend the Hugo/Academic pair.

But I am wandering off, let's go back to the main topic of this post.

## My Goals for 2020

I am always interested in almost everything... _I mean, really, quite everything,_ and in fact, I have started lots of side projects...

... of which I completed... 0.

For this reason, in 2020 I will try to stick to a low number of goals, and I will publicly account for them here, on this website. So, let's dive into the goals of 2020.

### **Improve development skills in C and Python**

I love sitting behind a computer creating pages of code, it is really relaxing for me ~~(at least when things are working)~~. The problem is that I still don't feel really fluent in Python, and I am still missing some fundamental concepts and skills in embedded C development.

_Since both of these skills are important in my work_ (and very important in the work market nowadays), I have decided to strengthen them during the year. These are the associated goals:

- [ ] Complete the **TI-RSLK Max Curriculum** for embedded programming.
- [ ] Constantly follow the _Better Developers_ newsletter by R. M. Lerner.
- [ ] Complete the freeCodeCamp _Coding Interview Prep_ and Python curriculums (when they will be launched).

### **Complete the deep learning course and start a personal project**

This goal is strictly related to the previous one. _Artificial intelligence is one of the hottest topics of the last few years_ and it is opening tons of new possibilities in a plethora of fields. I want to delve completely into this world. Since Python is a central language for AI, this is also the opportunity to stick to the previous goal.

- [ ] Complete the Deep Learning course on Coursera.
- [ ] Learn _Tensorflow._
- [ ] Apply AI in a personal project.

### **Increase income with a side project business**

Even though the thing I enjoy the most is programming, I am always attracted by the creation of objects, especially if this creation can be automated. I have a couple of small side-business idea that I would like to develop in 2020, and they include 3D printing and CNC machining. Stick around if you want to see more.

- [ ] Buy a 3D printer.
- [ ] Build a CNC machine.

### **Improve tea knowledge and tasting**

I don't want to improve only in "technical" skills. Tea is another great passion of mine, and I would really like to improve both in tea tasting and tea knowledge in general.

- [ ] Taste at least 20 new teas.
- [ ] Delve into the history and culture of each tasted tea.
- [ ] ~~Buy every teapot you find~~ (maybe not this one).

### **Constantly update this website**

I want this website to be the hub of every piece of my work and I will constantly update it with useful information (I hope). I will be especially active in updating the _Notes_ section, which I prefer instead of writing random posts on some topics. I will also complete the site customization.

- [ ] Create a _2020 Goals_ custom widget.
- [ ] Choose a better colour palette.
- [ ] Create my logo and... brand ~~(?? it sounds so strange)~~.

## Conclusion

This is the end of my first post. I have to admit that it was quite hard writing a post so personal. Let's hope accounting will help to stick to my goals and that future posts will be more consistent.

Happy 2020!
