Ciao! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Damiano Lodi. I am a <strong>software engineer</strong> at
[Opto Engineering](https://www.opto-e.com/en/).

This is my personal website. With time, I will populate it with notes about topics that I find interesting. Generally speaking, you will
find notes and projects related to <em>software engineering</em> (C++/embedded mostly), <em>productivity</em> and <em>project management</em>.
I will probably add some content covering my other hobbies (nowadays <strong>carnivorous plants</strong> and <strong>tea</strong>).

If you have some feedback on what you read (or if you spot any error), feel free to reach me through email via
<a href="[mailto:damiano.lodi.93@gmail.com](mailto:damiano.lodi.93@gmail.com)">email</a> or through one of the social linked below.
